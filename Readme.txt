Final Project
Elevator Assignment
	For this assignment I implemented the Elevator Assignment. In order to do this I need to create a class for Building, Person, Elevator, sim, and Simulation. This framework created a simulation for testing elevator operations. I thought that this assignment was very difficult to conceptualize but I try to implement it by giving the classes the responsibilities assigned in the instructions. I tried to add the codeclimate bag https://codeclimate.com/dashboard but the connection could not be verified.
